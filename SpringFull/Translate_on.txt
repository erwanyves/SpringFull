SPRINGFULL - Language Selection Control File
================================================================================

This file controls whether the language selection dialog appears at startup.

CURRENT MODE: MANUAL SELECTION (this file is newer)
- The language dialog will appear at each startup
- User can choose: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian

TO SWITCH TO AUTOMATIC MODE:
- Simply "touch" the Translate_off.txt file to update its timestamp
- Command: touch Translate_off.txt
- Or: open and save Translate_off.txt

The system compares the modification timestamps of both files:
- Translate_on.txt newer  → Show language dialog
- Translate_off.txt newer → Auto-detect system language
